Useful Software Engineering Definitions:

Functional requirements: are statements of what a software system must do to meet the needs of its users. They are typically written in plain language and should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.

Non-functional requirements: Non-functional requirements (NFRs) specify how a software system should perform, focusing on aspects like speed, security, and usability, rather than specific features.

Agile model: Small increments of software are developed in a sequence of sprints, each of which creates deployable code.

Waterflow model: The waterfall model is a linear, sequential approach to the software development lifecycle (SDLC) that is popular in software engineering and product development.

User stories: User stories are short conversational text; They consists of 2-4 sentences written by the stakeholders(in their own terminology)
